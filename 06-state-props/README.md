# State & Props

## Understanding State and Props

### Props
- Immutable data passed from parent to child
- Used for component configuration
- Read-only

### State
- Mutable data managed within a component
- Changes trigger re-renders
- Controlled by the component

## React Hooks

Modern React Native uses hooks for state management:
- **useState**: Manage component state
- **useEffect**: Handle side effects
- **useContext**: Access context values

## Examples

See [examples/](examples/) for practical implementations.
